Kafka Streams with Spring Cloud Stream - PageEvent Processing
This project demonstrates how to create a Kafka producer and consumer using Spring Cloud Stream and Kafka Streams to handle PageEvent objects. It includes a producer that sends PageEvent objects to a Kafka topic, a consumer that receives and displays these events, a supplier that generates events periodically, and a real-time processing pipeline using Kafka Streams to analyze the events. Additionally, a REST endpoint is provided for real-time visualization of the processed data.
